## I wanna see just the hidden files 

To only see all hidden files just do 

```
ls .*
```
*note that this will also show all contests of all hidden directories

## Go to home directory instantly

do `cd` wihtou any argument

```
cd
```

## Lost in debugging

If a command is not showing enough information when running try adding `--verbose` flag e.g.
```
command --versbose
```
normally commands show just enough information, this will output more info
